      Cynchorus is an independent research initiative exploring the architecture of human–machine teaming.
      We treat collaboration as a harmonic process — where data, ethics, and narrative align through resonance rather than control.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
      The project began as a study in cognitive systems and evolved into a design experiment: how to build frameworks
      where humans and intelligent agents can learn, disagree, and adapt together — transparently and with intent.

      Every layer of Cynchorus — from the Bias-Map to the Divergence Index — is a tool for reflexivity.
      Each aims to make cognition visible: a mirror for how we understand, decide, and evolve.
