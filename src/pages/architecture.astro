      The Moral–Cognitive Engine
    </h1>
    <p class="text-lg text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
      The Cynchorus framework is built around two harmonised subsystems: <span class="text-indigo-300/80">Epistemic Pluralism</span>
      and <span class="text-indigo-300/80">Value Pluralism</span>. Together they form a moral-cognitive engine capable of reflective
      reasoning and balanced decision-making.
    </p>
    <ul class="space-y-4 text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
      <li><span class="text-indigo-300/80">Epistemic Pluralism:</span> models multiple ways of knowing — scientific, narrative,
        experiential — through Bias-Maps and Divergence Indices.</li>
      <li><span class="text-indigo-300/80">Value Pluralism:</span> maps ethical dimensions like justice, autonomy, and empathy,
        balancing them dynamically via a Value-Weight Matrix.</li>
      <li><span class="text-indigo-300/80">Confluence Engine:</span> mediates between the two, producing decisions that are both
        informed and humane.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-lg text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
      This architecture turns philosophy into protocol — an attempt to encode humility, curiosity, and empathy into
      technical design. Each output carries its own uncertainty and bias profile, visible by design.
